        <h2>Welcome Brazilian Portuguese language lessons</h2>
        <p>I've been keeping this page on github intending to help some friends who would like to learn the grammar of this challenging language</p>
        <p>Despite my lack of time and capital to invest in this project (which is begin maintened very KISS, simple and stupid), It's a direct practical guide that goes direct to the main points which are required to understand the Portuguese language.</p>
        <p>This system is based on a front end hosted on a hosting server, an API hosted on a cloud server and a business server that provides the database artifacts and etc.</p>
        <p>Eventually the business server will be online or not because it's hosted on a machine which isn't everytime online.</p>
